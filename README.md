# Hemra · Blood Cell Pattern Research

**Live:** https://hemra-research.vercel.app/

A free, browser-based tool that scores a microscope image of a white blood cell against four learned types: **Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil**. Runs entirely in the browser; nothing is uploaded.

## About
- Classifies a single white blood cell image as eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte or neutrophil, entirely in the browser.
- Trained on pathologist-labelled images from the Acevedo et al. dataset (see Credits); 97.5% on 960 held-out test images from the same dataset.
- All images come from one hospital, one stain and one analyzer, from donors without infection, blood disease or cancer. Expect lower accuracy elsewhere.
- Details: [research page](https://hemra-research.vercel.app/research.html). Terms: [terms page](https://hemra-research.vercel.app/terms.html).

## Run
Static site: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`. Serve with any static server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`.
